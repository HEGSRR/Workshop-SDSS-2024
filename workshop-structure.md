## Introduction
- Need Statement
- Introductions
- Definition - Focus on the wider, deeper definition of reproducibility
- Open Science Practices - Graph from [2023 SDSS Workshop](https://hegsrr.github.io/Workshop-SDSS-2023/)
- Education Gap - Moving students to the left on the graph, by building competencies (But which ones, and how?)
- Two-levels in this workshop (1) Classroom, (2) Curriculum

## Classroom
### Introduction
- The idea in short - Attempt reproductions with students to allow them to develop essential competencies (R&R and otherwise)
- Intro PBL, Design elements table, Its effective (citations)
- Outline the 4 phases (within each phase Lec, Act, Assign)

### P1 - Review
- What do we do, section of the table
- Open Science Principles - NASEM, Data Dashboard (Joe)
- Critical Review - Chakraborty Student Highlights (Joe)
- Workflow - Image of workflow (Peter)
- Review Questions and Methods - Converge to workflow - SatScan, cluster analysis, GEE (Drew)

### P2 - Plan 
- What do we do, section of the table
- Intro compendium template - Screenshot & tab of strucutre for template (Joe)
- Intro PAP - Tab structure of PAP (Peter)
- Critique of 'concerns', plan of adjustments - Issues in cluster assignment (Joe)
- Submit PAP, commit to GitHub - final plan doc, OSF Registrations - (Drew)

### P3 - Attempt
- What do we do, section of the table
- Implement Plan - legible code w/in notebook, show notebook
- Catalog Decisions - unplanned deviation added to notebook, visual product
- Compare Results - Forest plot (Peter)
- 

### Research Products
- These approach yields research products - Table 

### P4 - Share

## Curriculum
- Emphasize the need to shift what you teach and how you evaluate. This model produces a more rounded student capable (and perhaps already) participating in the scientific community.
- Preview of our model (Rubric)

## Notes
- Create a handout that indexes key ideas and elements
- The available reproduction people can use to kick start the class
