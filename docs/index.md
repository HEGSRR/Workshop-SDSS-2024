## Expected Participation

Primarily, the tutorial is intended for **educators** interested in incorporating lessons on reproducibility and replicability into their courses, or attempting to reproduce published work with their students and scholars with administrative responsibilities for **curriculum development** within their department, or across their institution.
Secondarily, the tutorial will be useful for **students** and **researchers** interested in improving the reproducibility of their own spatial data science research.
